# demand-response-research
Simple demand response (DR) server application that includes a BACnet IoT gateway that would reside inside a building written in bacpypes3, a cloud server web app written in Flask, 
and an additional Python script that can post DR event data to the web app.

The BACnet app contains an algorithm for the research project that is specifically built for integrating automated window blind shades, HVAC, and POE lighting control sequences under different DR modes.
