# smart-building-wasm-experiment

This project demonstrates an integration of Rust and Python in a smart building context. It uses Rust to create a WebAssembly (WASM) module for smart building logic, and Python to simulate an edge device interacting with the building's control systems.


## Rust Code and Algorithm
The Rust component creates a WASM module that represents a basic smart building system. It includes logic to adjust building utilities like HVAC and lighting based on Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) signals.


## Key Components
* **BuildingSystem**: A struct representing the state of the building's systems, such as HVAC and lighting.
* **CPPSignal**: A struct representing a CPP signal, including price and duration.
* **OperationalMode**: An enum representing different operational modes of the building system.

## Building and Running
To set up and compile the Rust code into a WebAssembly module, follow these steps:

1. **Install Rust**: Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Add WASM Target**: Add the WASM target to your Rust toolchain:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
3. **Compile to WASM**: Navigate to the root directory of the Rust project and compile:
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

This will generate the WASM file at target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/smart_building.wasm.

## Python Edge Device Simulation

### Overview
The Python script `wasm_interact.py` simulates an edge device in a smart building. It interacts with the WASM module generated by the Rust code to read and write data to the building's control systems.
* note- tested on Python 3.7 it appears there are some issues with the `wasmer` package on newer versions of Python.

### Setup
1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install wasmer
```
### Running the Script
```python
python wasm_interact.py
```
